The goal is to pack lightly as most lodges and camps will launder clothes for a small fee. Safaris are informal, and there is no need to dress up. Do plan to dress in layers so you can adjust to temperature changes as early morning game drives can be quite cold depending on the time of year while daytime temperatures can get quite warm. Stick to neutral or khaki colors and avoid wearing dark blue or black clothes as these colors tend to attract tsetse flies.</p><p></p><p>Wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses, sunscreen, and insect repellent are a necessity.

From incredible game reserves teeming with wildlife to glorious beaches, luxurious accommodations and incredible culture and food. Here are just 10 reasons why you should think about spending your next holiday there.</p><p></p><h5>1. The Great Migration</h5><p>Africa is full of amazing wildlife experiences but one of the most spectacular to witness is the Great Migration. A once in a lifetime experience and on the bucket list of many a traveller to Africa, none can surpass this incredible spectacle: a million wildebeest crossing the plains of the&nbsp;Serengeti&nbsp;in search of fresh grass while braving predators and perilous river crossings.</p><p></p><h5>2. Mount Kilimanjaro</h5><p>Located in North Eastern Tanzania, Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and can be seen from far into Kenya. The mountain represents a powerful life force for the local Chagga people and all those who have made their lives around the mountain, providing rich volcanic soils for agriculture and an endless source of pure spring waters. 75,000 people climb Kilimanjaro every year so it is not the most untouched mountain, nor is it the most arduous, however, it is still an awe-inspiring sight to behold and highly recommended for anyone with even a vague interest in mountaineering.</p><h5></h5><h5>3. Zanzibar</h5><p>What better way to round off a safari adventure through Tanzania than to spend some time relaxing in&nbsp;Zanzibar&nbsp;on one of its beautiful white sand beaches? Known as the “Spice Island”, Zanzibar has brought visitors from other lands since time immemorial – Persians, Chinese, Arabs, Indians and many more have all sailed their vessels into Zanzibar’s harbour over the centuries, bent on trade and sometimes plunder. Make sure to visit Stone Town to explore its spice markets and superb Arabic architecture. If diving is more your thing then learn to dive at one of the many dive centres the local resorts boast – the waters around the island are very clear and host a huge diversity of marine life.</p><p></p><h5>4. The Food</h5><p>Tanzanian cuisine is a mix of traditional African food, with a strong Arabic/Indian influence, especially along the coast and in Zanzibar. Surrounded by the ocean, Zanzibar is renowned for its seafood with most hotels in the area offering a fantastic variety of fresh seafood menus. For the ultimate foodie experience, visit the Stone Town night food market. Offering a variety of delicious eats, this lively market is a must-see to experience the local people and culture.</p><p></p><h5>5. Outstanding Accommodation Options</h5><p>Tanzania provides visitors with a variety of choices when it comes to accommodation. For the ultimate luxury safari experience there is the Four Seasons Serengeti, for those looking for an authentic tented safari experience there are camps like&nbsp;&amp;Beyond Serengeti Under Canvas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Selous Serena Camp&nbsp;and for honeymooners or couples, Zanzibar offers a plethora of luxury resorts such as&nbsp;Hideaway of Nungwi&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ras Kutani.</p><p></p><h5>6. The Maasai People</h5><p>The Maasai people of East Africa live in southern Kenya and northern Tanzania along the Great Rift Valley on semi-arid and arid lands. They’re well known for the special red cloth they wear which is called a Shuka and their highly energetic customs. They openly welcome visitors to the area to experience their culture and lifestyle first-hand.</p><p></p><h5>7. Wildlife and Birdlife</h5><p>Tanzania has the largest concentration and diversity of animals in Africa and there are over 1000 bird species to spot in the country. Tanzania is home to some of the world’s most treasured national parks and game reserves including the&nbsp;Selous Game Reserve, which is the world’s largest game reserve and home to more than 120,000 elephants, 160,000 buffalos and 2000 rhinos. Selous is also home to large concentrations of hippos, crocodiles and wild dogs.</p><p></p><h5>8. The Ngorongoro Crater</h5><p>A jewel in Tanzania’s crown is the&nbsp;Ngorongoro Crater, the world’s largest intact volcanic caldera and haven to a wondrous array of animal life which makes the crater a “must do” on any visit to Tanzania. The backdrop of the crater walls makes for some stunning photographic opportunities as you see the animals wander through the grasslands on the crater floor towards the lake.</p><p></p><h5>9. The Western and Southern Safari Parks</h5><p>Southern and western Tanzania are very often overlooked by travellers intent on visiting the more well-known parks of the north, yet these regions are highly regarded among serious safari-goers. The southern parks of&nbsp;Selous and Ruaha&nbsp;offer seriously good wildlife, plus a wider choice of activities and much better value for money than can be found in Northern Tanzania. The remote western parks of&nbsp;Mahale&nbsp;and&nbsp;Katavi&nbsp;are expensive and more difficult to get to, however, they do both offer a unique safari and African wilderness experience<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><h5>10. Chimpanzees in Mahale National Park</h5><p>The small and remote Mahale Mountains National Park is found in the very West of Tanzania and on the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika. Chimpanzee treks are the main draw card here and seeing them in their natural habitat is a truly magical experience. When you are with the chimps you will be able to observe their very human-like behaviour as the younger ones play in the trees and the adults observe and squabble amongst themselves.</p><p></p>','10-reasons-why-you-should-visit-tanzania','Tanzania remains one of the favorite places in the world to see wildlife in its utmost Natural state, featuring the best National Park in Africa (Serengeti)','/images/3d6f702b-18b0-40c6-9fd3-70b2340fec51.webp','/images/3d6f702b-18b0-40c6-9fd3-70b2340fec51.webp','/images/3d6f702b-18b0-40c6-9fd3-70b2340fec51.webp','Tanzania remains one of the most beloved and enchanting safari destinations in the world, and we\'ve compiled the ten reasons to visit Tanzania.

Not sure if you need to take malaria pills or whether you’ll have much WiFi access over there? You’ll find the answers to all these questions and more with our Top Travel Tips covering everything from pre-travel health advice to money, shopping and more.</p><p></p><h5>What vaccinations do I need for Tanzania?</h5><p>You should seek medical advice from your local health practitioner before travelling to Tanzania and ensure that you receive all of the appropriate vaccinations. As a guide Polio, Diphtheria, Hepatitis A &amp; B, Typhoid and Tetanus are strongly recommended. Meningitis and Rabies are also recommended.</p><p>A Yellow Fever International Certificate of Vaccination is required if arriving from countries infected with yellow fever or if you were in transit through infected areas (unless you remained on board or at the airport). This is particularly relevant if travelling from neighbouring African countries. If visiting Zanzibar from mainland Tanzania, a yellow fever certificate must be produced to gain entry.</p><p></p><h5>Do I need anti-malaria tablets for Tanzania?</h5><p>There is a risk of malaria in Tanzania so it is very important to check with your doctor before you go, to see whether malarial medication is required for the areas you are visiting. Generally, it is good practice to avoid mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved, light-coloured clothes and wearing mosquito repellent that contains at least 50% DEET. For more information on the malaria risk in Tanzania visit the NHS Fit to Travel&nbsp;page or the&nbsp;CDC Traveler’s Health&nbsp;page.</p><p></p><h5>What is the plastic bag ban?</h5><p>Tanzania has introduced a ban on plastic bags effective from June 1st 2019. All travellers arriving at a Tanzania airport could face heavy fines for using plastic bags in any way, shape or form. These include shopping bags, garbage bags and “zip-lock” plastic bags used for transporting liquids and cosmetics.</p><p>We recommend that you avoid packing any plastic bags in your suitcase or carry-on luggage before travelling to Tanzania. If you do purchase any items at your departure airport, be sure to take them out of their plastic bags. Double-check your hand luggage before disembarking and leave any plastic bags on the plane.</p><p></p><h5>Is it safe to drink tap water in Tanzania?</h5><p>The tap water in Tanzania is not considered safe to drink. You should drink bottled mineral water, which is readily available in shops, hotels and restaurants. Make sure you purchase this from reputable outlets and that the seal on the bottle is not broken.</p><h5></h5><h5>What’s the food like in Tanzania?</h5><p>The most common staples found in Tanzanian cuisine are rice and ugali, a thick, white paste made from cornmeal that is served alongside a sauce-based stew or meat dish. Chapatis, as can be found in India, also make the base of many meals along with beans and mchicha, a green vegetable that resembles spinach. Accompanying these staples are several different meat-centric dishes, such as grilled chicken or nyama choma, roasted beef or goat.</p><p>Once you hit the coast, seafood makes more of an appearance and one delicious dish is the octopus in a creamy coconut curry. Snacks are also widely available, a popular choice of which are samosas, brought over to Tanzania from India. Roasted corn with lemon and chilli salt is also a favourite with locals and can be bought from street-side grills. Meals can be washed down with a hot cup of chai tea or a local beer, such as Safari, Kilimanjaro or Castle.</p><p></p><h5>Safe eating while travelling in Tanzania</h5><p>Be wary when eating outside of high-end lodges as sometimes the quality of the meat and the way in which it has been prepared might not be suitable for a sensitive western stomach. Also be aware that food hygiene in Tanzania is much more basic than you will be used to so if something looks unclean, old or badly cooked, it is best to avoid it altogether. It is also a good idea to avoid ice in your drink and eating salad as these might come into contact with unhygienic water.</p><p></p><h5>Is it standard to tip in Tanzania?</h5><p>There is no set procedure when it comes to tipping in Tanzania but be aware that most people in the service industry earn very little and depend on gratuities to make up their income. Safari guides should be tipped the equivalent of about USD $10-15 per day and a few dollars should go to the driver, cook and porters when travelling on an overland safari. If you eat in a restaurant then 10% on top of the bill is a suitable amount to leave. When it comes to taxis, rounding up the fare is a nice way to show your appreciation, especially if they have successfully navigated the chaotic streets of Dar es Salaam for you.</p><p></p><h5>What is good to shop for in Tanzania?</h5><p>The most popular purchase for travellers in Tanzania is a traditional wooden carving, usually in the shape of a mask or tribes person. A close second to this is the soapstone sculptures that can be found in boutiques as well as marketplaces. Another excellent item to take home with you is a Maasai blanket, which is brightly coloured and similar in pattern to tartan and can be used as tablecloths, picnic blankets or even clothes.</p><p>If you’re looking for something to wear, colourful kangas, which look like sarongs, are widely available. You might also want to look out for some tinga-tinga art, a unique style to Tanzania that encompasses bright colours and a cartoon-ish style and usually depicts safari animals or African scenes. Another uniquely Tanzanian product is Tanzanite, a deep blue precious gem that can only be found in the country. If you want to buy one of these stones it is a good idea to do your research beforehand or take a trustworthy and knowledgeable guide who can make sure you’re getting the real deal.</p><p></p><h5>Is bargaining acceptable in Tanzania?</h5><p>Bargaining in Tanzania is not just acceptable but it is expected and you will find that as a tourist you will be told a much higher price than a local would be offered. Don’t let this annoy or offend you as chances are you have more money in your wallet than most of the other people in the market will see in a month or even a year. Don’t let yourself be ripped off but also be prepared to pay slightly over the odds for something.</p><p></p><h5>Is it safe for a single woman to travel to Tanzania?</h5><p>A lot of travellers visit Tanzania as part of a safari tour and in this context, visiting Tanzania is very safe for solo women as they will be away from crowded cities and under the protection of their guide and lodge at all times. However, those who visit Tanzania independently might have a slightly different experience. Harassment from local men is common but is usually just an annoyance rather than a threat. Nevertheless, you will want to avoid this by dressing conservatively, wearing sunglasses to avoid eye contact and carrying a photo of a man in your purse who you can say is your husband. You should also try to limit your nighttime travel as much as possible.</p><p></p><h5>How about as a member of the LGBT community?</h5><p>Currently, homosexuality is illegal in Tanzania, and sexual activity with someone of the same gender is punishable in prison, especially for males. Whilst an outdated view, this does not mean that Tanzanians are inhospitable or unfriendly people. In fact, Tanzania is generally a very welcoming country, homosexuality is just not accepted like it is in other parts of the world today. Any LGBT traveller wishing to explore Tanzania would be best to behave with discretion and not engage in any flirting or sexual activity with anyone of the same sex whilst visiting the country. As long as travellers act with discretion, there is no reason to expect any problems.</p><p></p><h5>What is the duty-free allowance for Tanzania?</h5><p>Travellers over 17 are permitted to bring the following into Tanzania:250g of cigarettes, cigars and tobacco (combined weight)1 litre of spirits or wine500ml of perfume and eau de toilette, of which no more than a quarter may be perfume, Unlicensed firearms and ammunition are banned from being imported into Tanzania.</p><p></p><h5>What is the currency in Tanzania?</h5><p>The official currency in Tanzania is the Tanzania Shilling. Check&nbsp;OANDA&nbsp;for the latest exchange rates.</p><p>Euro, British Pounds, US Dollars, South African Rand and other major currencies can be exchanged locally or in advance of departure. Additionally, exchange facilities are available at various bureau de changes and banks in major towns have ATMs. It’s advisable to request bank notes in smaller denominations, as it can sometimes be hard to get change from large notes and smaller notes are handy for smaller purchases and gratuities. Traveller’s Cheques are not recommended as they’re often difficult to exchange and incur high fees.</p><p></p><h5>What do things cost in Tanzania?</h5><p>Generally, those on safari will have their accommodation and food costs included in their tour package. However, those heading to the big cities should expect to pay around USD $50 per night for mid-range hotels and around USD $100 for the best accommodation options. Street food is widely available and costs anything from a few cents to USD $3 depending on how hungry you are. A sit-down meal with a beer can cost up to around USD $10. Public transport is cheap and long bus journeys can come in at as little as a few dollars.</p><p></p><h5>What sort of plugs do I need for Tanzania and what is the voltage?</h5><p>The standard voltage is 230 – 240 volts. Primary sockets generally require the 3 square-pin variety, similar to the United Kingdom sockets. We recommend that you pack a universal travel adaptor. You will need a voltage converter and plug adaptor in order to use U.S. appliances.</p><h5></h5><h5>Is WiFi widely available in Tanzania?</h5><p>WiFi is common in Tanzania’s main cities but be aware that connections can be slower and less secure than you might be used to back home. In the national parks, there is very rarely a WiFi connection as guests are encouraged to disconnect and immerse themselves in nature.</p><p></p><h5>What time zone is Tanzania in?</h5><p>Tanzania is 3 hours ahead of GMT and does not observe daylight savings.</p><p></p><h5>Travelling with Children</h5><p>In Africa selected departures of our overland safaris are classified as ‘Family Friendly’ and these are noted under ‘Prices and Dates’ on the relevant tours. Family Friendly departures welcome children aged 6 – 17 years travelling with their parents on tour. Please note children will be occupying a seat on the overland truck, therefore they pay full price. Parents must be aware that travellers aged 18 years and older still frequent the trip and the tour is a participation overland tour. Children aged eight and above travelling with a parent or guardian are also welcome on lodge safaris in Tanzania on a request basis and subject to the agreement of the other passengers. Please note that children aged 12+ pay the adult price. We can tailor-make private safaris for families and those travelling with younger children.</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><p></p></li><li><p></p></li><li><p></p></li><li><p></p></li></ul>','Tanzania-Travel-Tips-Useful-info','Tanzania Safari planning.','/images/a133a0af-1559-4f55-9360-2c66303e2cba.jpg','/images/a133a0af-1559-4f55-9360-2c66303e2cba.jpg','/images/a133a0af-1559-4f55-9360-2c66303e2cba.jpg','Planning your trip can be confusing and perhaps a little bit frustrating and that\'s where we come in with our top Tanzania travel tips!','Expert','2007-02-28'),(6,'Top 10 Unmissable Things to Do in Zanzibar','<p>Whether you’re looking for somewhere to relax after climbing Kilimanjaro or just want to hang out in an island paradise, Zanzibar Island has a lot to offer!</p><p>This island is located off the Eastern coast of Africa and it has a rich history as a trading outpost and a colony, meaning there are many more things to do in Zanzibar besides just hitting the beach.</p><p></p><h5>1. CHECK OUT STONE TOWN</h5><p>People have been living on the island for over 20,000 years, but&nbsp;Stone Town&nbsp;is the central point of Zanzibar. Because of its location off the coast and its sheltered harbor, Stone Town turned from a fishing village into a trading center. The island also was governed by many colonial rulers, from Portugal to Oman to Great Britain, until it became independent in 1963.</p><p></p><p>As a trading center, the island has plenty of cultural influences from colonizers and traders from India and Arab countries.&nbsp; Slavery also affected the island as it was used as a port to send slaves abroad while hundreds of slaves also worked on plantations on the island. It’s a mix of African, Arabic, and colonial styles all packed into one city. Because of all the unique influences, Stone Town has actually declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site&nbsp;in 2000!</p><p></p><p>The best way to get a feel for this city is to wander around the narrow maze of streets. You’ll definitely get lost, but that’s half the fun! You’ll also probably be able to tell quickly that a lot of things haven’t been properly maintained since the colonial era. The older facades of the buildings are part of what gives Stone Town its unique charm!</p><p></p><p>Stone Town itself is fairly small with a population of just 16,000 residents living inside the city in 2016. The town’s economy is now primarily based on tourism and it is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in Tanzania.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>FUN FACT:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Stone Town is actually one part of Zanzibar City. The other area of the city is called Ng’ambo, which is more modern. Stone Town is the more historical section. So if you see the two names used interchangeably, it’s because Stone Town is part of Zanzibar City!</em></p><p></p><h5>Things to do in Stone Town</h5><p>Besides just wandering around the streets, there are lots of things to do in Stone Town. This is the perfect city to really get a better understanding of Zanzibar\'s people and culture.</p><p></p><p>Here are a few things I recommend checking out in Stone Town:</p><h5></h5><h5>TAKE A GUIDED WALKING TOUR</h5><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Most hotels offer guided day tours around the city and I definitely recommend doing the tour with a guide. All the tourists you’ll see walking around are led by guides. You will learn so much more information with a guide and it’s not that expensive either! I definitely recommend it – you won’t regret it! Your guide can also tell you about the dark past of the island.</p></blockquote><h5>ADMIRE STONE TOWN’S INTRICATE DOORS</h5><p>The fascinating architecture of the buildings starts with their doors! As you wander through the streets, make sure you look around at the beautiful, carved doors that are a special feature of the city.</p><p>The designs and carvings of the doors tell about the residents who lived there. You can also tell whether the doors are Swahili, Indian, or Arab based on the shape and design!</p><p></p><h5>SEE THE BIRTHPLACE OF FREDDIE MERCURY</h5><p>If you love Queen, don’t miss out on the chance to see where Freddie Mercury was born – it is located right in the city center, so you won’t miss it! (Or just search Freddie Mercury’s birthplace on Google Maps). Some people say this might not be the real house (because his father moved several times when Freddie was young), but it’s still a great opportunity to learn a little more about the background and upbringing of this amazing singer!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>ADMIRE THE OLD FORT</h5><p>This is exactly what the name says it is! Take a look around a unique piece of history and check out&nbsp;The Old Fort. This is an old fortification built by the Omani Arabs in 1699.&nbsp; It is also one of the oldest buildings in town.</p><p></p><p>A more recent addition to the fort is an open-air amphitheater where you can watch local shows or other events. You can ask the tourist information desk at the fort if there are any upcoming events that could fit into your Zanzibar travel plans.</p><h5></h5><h5>VISIT THE HOUSE OF WONDERS</h5><p>This was unfortunately closed for renovation while I was there, but I’ll definitely be visiting on my next trip to Zanzibar! This is the tallest and largest building in town and was originally a palace facing the town’s central square. The building is now home to the&nbsp;National Museum of History and Culture.</p><p></p><h5>LEARN ABOUT THE SLAVE TRADE AT THE SLAVE MUSEUM</h5><p>As I mentioned before, the island has a dark past. This market was the last functioning slave market in the world and it only closed in 1873.&nbsp; Although this might seem like a bit of a downer, it’s an important part of the history of the region. Thousands of Africans were brought to the island as slaves to work on plantations. Slave traders also used the island as a base camp before sending slaves on the long journey to the East to be sold in Persia, Arabia, the Ottoman Empire, and Egypt.</p><p></p><p>At the Slave Museum, you can tour chambers where they kept slaves before they were sold.</p><p>We went down to see the “rooms” where slaves were kept – a 12 by 12-foot basement with one tiny window near the ceiling. They kept over 30 people in these types of rooms. Although this happened hundreds of years ago it still gave me shivers as I stood there!</p><p></p><p><em>You might need a pick-me-up after, but it’ll help you understand more about the island and its people.</em></p><p><em>The museum is open every day from 8 am to 6 pm. There is a $5 USD entrance fee and you can expect to spend about an hour in the museum.</em></p><p></p><h5>VISIT ONE OF THE ROOFTOP RESTAURANTS</h5><p>After a long day of taking in the sites and the culture, I recommend finding a rooftop restaurant for dinner and a drink as the sun sets. I recommend&nbsp;The Tea House Restaurant. It’s a great place to see the sunset, but make sure to make a reservation in advance! The restaurant gets busy with other tourists who want to enjoy the view as well.</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Another option is&nbsp;The Beach House Restaurant, which has an amazing outdoor balcony overlooking the water. The food is a mix of Italian, French, and Mediterranean and it’s delicious! You can also check out&nbsp;6 Degrees South, which is perfect for a romantic dinner looking out at the ocean.</p></li><li><p></p></li></ul><h5>WANDER AROUND DARAJANI MARKET</h5><p>While you’re there, why not wander around the main bazaar in town? You’ll definitely get a taste of life in Zanzibar – and a whiff as well! I found the market to be a really authentic experience.There is an indoor section of the market, but also a lot of pop-up vendors on the surrounding streets.&nbsp; You’ll be able to experience a lot of traditional Zanzibar food and ingredients, as well as admire clothes, shoes, and traditional hats.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Be prepared for the smell since part of this market is a fish market!</em></p><p></p><h5>FORODHANI GARDENS</h5><p>Although I wouldn’t call these actual “gardens,” this is the central square of Stone Town.&nbsp; It has lots of trees and is a hotspot for locals and tourists alike.&nbsp; I recommend going after sunset and enjoying the street food market. To get the full experience, look around for the stands that have the longest lines of locals and try some authentic Zanzibar dishes here (this means the food is good!).</p><p></p><p><strong><em>PRO TIP:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Locals recommend avoiding the seafood here though – it’s not always fresh!</em></p><p><strong><em>PRO TIP 2:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;As a central spot for tourists, be careful of people trying to overcharge you or pretending to be waiters. Some tourists have had issues with “waiters” trying to charge them ridiculously high prices!</em></p><p></p><h5>DRINK COFFEE AT JAWS CORNER</h5><p>It might take you a while to find it as it’s among the narrow streets, but&nbsp;Jaws Corner&nbsp;is a small plaza. You can stop by and try the Arabic-style local coffee. Just be prepared – it’s definitely not like a cup of coffee with cream and sugar like you might be used to! It’s typically served black and bitter, and it is VERY strong.</p><p></p><h5>DO SOME SHOPPING</h5><p>There are so many little boutique stores all over Stone Town. There’s a bunch on Ginzenga Street, Kenyatta Road, and Changa Bazaar Street. You’ll also be sure to see some great stores for souvenirs as you’re wandering around.</p><p></p><p><em>I wasn’t planning on buying anything, but I loved the jewelry so much, I bought myself a pair of earrings! There are excellent places there where you can get some Zanzibar souvenirs to bring home!</em></p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Zanzibar is a predominantly Muslim island. As a female traveler visiting Stone Town, you might want to dress conservatively.</em></p><p></p><h5>2. TAKE A BOAT TRIP AND ENJOY SNORKELING IN ZANZIBAR!</h5><p>If you want to do a&nbsp;safari in Zanzibar, you can consider a sea adventure safari as well!&nbsp;&nbsp;Safari Blue is a company that offers full-day tours where you can swim or snorkel. Leaving Stone Town, these tours are one of the best ways to experience snorkeling in Zanzibar. You might also get a chance to swim with dolphins!</p><p></p><p>Depending on which tour you choose, you will be taken to several different places, from a sandbar to a lagoon. You’ll also get a full buffet lunch, which is usually grilled right on the beach! You can also sail in one of the traditional Dhows (boats used by Arabs and Indians that have large triangular sails).</p><p>There are a bunch of companies that offer similar tours, but Safari Blue is the most well-known. It’s also the most expensive and, while you can find identical ones for much less, they might not be of the same quality.</p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for something more exclusive, you can book your own Dhow (at $450 USD for two people) or even charter a private yacht! There are plenty of other options to choose from as well, depending on your preferences and budget.</p><p></p><p><em>Also, be sure to book directly through the company, as some places charge you extra for the booking!</em></p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;You may have heard of dolphin tours in Zanzibar. These tours typically use the boats to scare the dolphins and prevent them from leaving an area so that tourists can swim with them. It’s dangerous and scary for the animals. Safari Blue doesn’t offer a specific “dolphin tour,” so you can see and swim with dolphins if they happen to be around where you are, but they don’t scare the animals or do anything unethical!</em></p><p></p><h5>3. TRY SOME LOCAL DISHES – EXPERIENCE AUTHENTIC ZANZIBAR FOOD</h5><blockquote><p>&nbsp;You can get these local dishes anywhere on the island if you know where to go, but Stone Town might be the easiest place (and most authentic!) to try them. For you foodies out there, there are also several food tours you can take, in case you don’t want to discover everything by yourself or if you are short on time. For example, the&nbsp;3-hour “Taste of Zanzibar” guided tour&nbsp;will bring you to various local stalls and restaurants where you can try authentic flavors. You can also do a 2-hour&nbsp;Afternoon Food Expedition&nbsp;which includes a traditional lunch, as well as other samples.</p></blockquote><p>If you want to go around the city and try some authentic food by yourself, here are some traditional dishes I can recommend:</p><p></p><p><strong>Zanzibar pizza</strong></p><p>You might be thinking that you’ve had pizza before, but not like this! This isn’t like any pizza you’ve ever seen. It’s more like a pancake or&nbsp;pupusa. The dough is folded up so that all the ingredients are inside and then it’s cooked on a hot metal pan. You can get these with chicken or beef, and they usually also include an egg, cheese, onion, bell peppers, and mayo. You can also get it with chili if you like spice! If you’re looking for a sweet treat, some vendors even make these with Nutella or mango and cheese.</p><p></p><p><strong>Biryani and pilau</strong></p><p>There are two rice dishes that are traditional on the island – biryani and pilau. To make&nbsp;<strong>biryani</strong>, the rice is cooked separately from the meat and sauce. Once everything is finished, then everything is combined and it’s served with an amazing sauce.</p><p></p><p><strong>Pilau</strong>&nbsp;is cooked all together with all the ingredients in the same pot, giving the rice an incredible flavor. You can get it either with your choice of meat or without any meat. I recommend that you try both and see which you like better!</p><p></p><p><strong>Urojo Soup</strong></p><p>This is a flour-based soup with mango and lemon flavors. It also usually has potatoes served three ways in it – cubed, fried mashed potatoes, and potato shavings- along with lots of spices and meat. With a slightly sour flavor and a lot of tang, this soup is something you definitely have to try! It’s a lunchtime favorite of Zanzibar people.</p><p></p><p><strong>Zanzibar tea</strong></p><p>Zanzibar isn’t known as the “spice island” for nothing! When I came back from my hike to Kilimanjaro, I was feeling a bit under the weather. This tea was a really amazing blend of spices and helped me clear my throat!</p><p></p><p><strong>Mishkaki (maybe with an octopus!)</strong></p><p>Mishkaki is a meat kabob where the meat is marinated in spices and then grilled. These are common snack food and you can get them with any kind of meat you like. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can even try them with an octopus! The island is known for its “octopus hunters”, so octopus is a common addition to lots of dishes.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>PRO TIP:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Be careful where you get these, as some places reheat them after they’ve been sitting out. It’s best to watch them grill yours so you can see that it’s fresh.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>Mandazi</strong></p><p>Mandazi is a fried dough, a bit similar to a donut, but not as sweet. These are eaten alone or with dips and accompany a lot of dishes.</p><p></p><h5>Learn to Cook Zanzibar Food</h5><p>If you completely fall in love with the flavors of Zanzibar, you can&nbsp;take a cooking class&nbsp;and learn how to bring the food home with you! Most tours will take you out to the market to collect the ingredients and then show you how to prepare traditional Zanzibar food. You’ll end the day with a full belly and a lot of new knowledge! Some classes also include a spice tour so you can do both on the same day. Prices start at $41 USD a person.</p><p></p><h5>4. TAKE A SPICE TOUR IN ZANZIBAR</h5><p>Early settlers soon learned that the island was perfect for growing a variety of different spices. As a result, there are lots of spice farms on the island. You’ll also taste the spices in the food, of course!</p><p>One fun thing to do is to take a spice tour where you can visit a spice farm and learn about how they grow and process all the different spices.</p><p></p><p>I did&nbsp;a spice tour combined with a town tour&nbsp;of Stone Town. It was a long day (and it involved a bit of walking!) so you can consider doing them separately, but it’s up to you! Plus, this is also a great Zanzibar attraction if you’re traveling with kids.</p><p></p><p>The spice farms are free to visit, but the guides work for tips. You can also&nbsp;book a 3-hour tour&nbsp;for $36 USD a person if you want a private experience. If you’re short on time and want to see the town and a spice farm, the 6-hour&nbsp;Sultan Panorama Tour&nbsp;will show you everything you want to see in Stone Town – you’ll visit a spice farm, and you’ll get to see a local village!</p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Please note that spice tours are a VERY touristy thing to do. The guides will start making your crowns out of palm trees or other accessories before you know it. If you’re not a fan of these kinds of things, you might be a better offer to avoid these tours. On the other hand, if you don’t mind something touristy, you’ll actually get to learn a lot about spices! We got to see cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, and cloves.</em></p><p></p><h5>5. VISIT JOZANI FOREST</h5><blockquote><p>&nbsp;These monkeys are black and white with red backs and you’ll be sure to see a few if you visit the forest. You’ll also see lots of birds and unique butterflies, too!The park is open every day from 7:30 am to 5:00 pm. There is an entrance fee of $8 USD that includes a brief tour. Then you can wander around the mangrove boardwalk on your own. You can tip your guide if you like, but it’s not mandatory.</p></blockquote><p>When I visited Zanzibar, we had just come back from an amazing safari, so we opted out of visiting Jozani Chwaka Bay National Park only because we didn’t think there was any chance it could compare to our epic safari adventure! It’s best to hit the forest if you’re heading from Stone Town to Paje Beach (or the other way around). That way you can stop along the way and not make a detour for a quick visit.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Tanzania is full of national parks. In fact, 45% of the country’s territory is a protected area! But there’s only one on the island so you really should visit it if you want the chance to see some unique Zanzibar wildlife!</em></p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h5>6. TRY KITESURFING IN ZANZIBAR!</h5><p><em>If you are searching for some adventurous things to do in Zanzibar – try kitesurfing! It’s one of the best spots in the world to do it!</em></p><p>Kitesurfing is a sport where you ride standing up on a small surfboard or kiteboard and let the wind drag you along while you hold onto a kite. This is a full-body sport and you’ll definitely be feeling a bit sore the next day!</p><p></p><p>Paje is considered to be the best place to kitesurf, but you can also take lessons at Nungwi Beach or Jambiani Beach. In fact, most tourist beaches offer kitesurfing lessons, so if you’re just starting out you can pretty much give it a go anywhere!</p><p></p><p><strong><em>PRO TIP:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>The best time to go if you want to kitesurf is&nbsp;</em><strong><em>from January to February</em></strong><em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</em><strong><em>June to September</em></strong><em>. If you’re there during this time, you might also get to see some expert kite surfers doing tricks and jumps!</em></p><p><em>There are plenty of different instructors and centers where you can learn to kitesurf, so shop around based on where you are and see what works for your timeframe and budget. One option is&nbsp;Kite Centre Zanzibar,&nbsp;which offers lessons for beginners (all equipment included) starting at around $330 USD per person.</em></p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>By the way, if you want to check out a place in Zanzibar to surf, most kitesurfing places also offer surfing as well</em></p><p><em>.</em></p><h5>7. HEAD TO THE NORTH OF THE ISLAND – NUNGWI BEACH</h5><p>Most of you are probably already planning on hitting this popular beach and, if it’s not on your must-see list, it should be!&nbsp; This is the island paradise you’re dreaming of – picture-perfect soft, white sand beaches and clear turquoise water.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Zanzibar beaches that aren’t part of a hotel or resort aren’t really well taken care of and there tends to be a lot of garbage on them so don’t waste your time visiting them. Instead, go to the beaches that have some infrastructure. If there is at least one restaurant nearby, that’s a good indication that the beach around it is probably swimmable.</em></p><p></p><p>Kendwa Beach is right around the corner (10 minutes by car) from Nungwi Beach. You should check it out too and, while you’re there, don’t forget to watch the amazing sunset!</p><h5></h5><h5>8. EAT AT THE ROCK RESTAURANT IN ZANZIBAR</h5><p>Zanzibar doesn’t have a ton of attractions in the typical sense of the word, but&nbsp;The Rock Zanzibar&nbsp;might just be one of them! It is something that you’ve probably already seen on postcards as well!</p><p>This is a unique restaurant that is off the coast of Pingwe, located on actual rock. Depending on the tides, you may have to wade out into the water to reach the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>To get the full experience, the best time to go there is during the day for lunch. For dinner, it will usually be too dark to really see all the surroundings (and it gets dark quite early – around 6 pm).</p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Because of its popularity, the restaurant has pre-set seating times. You must book in advance and arrive to eat either at 12 pm or 2 pm (for lunch).</em></p><p></p><p>The Rock Zanzibar prices are a bit higher than some other restaurants in the area because of how unique the dining experience is. Expect to pay at least $60 USD per person for a proper lunch.</p><p></p><h5>9. VISIT THE PRISON ISLAND</h5><p>This island is off the coast of Stone Town and is also known as Changuu Island (don’t mix it up with&nbsp;Canggu in Bali!).&nbsp; Although Prison Island in Zanzibar seems like an intimidating name (and like it might not be a fun day trip!), it’s a bit of a misnomer.&nbsp;<strong>There never actually was a prison on the island</strong>. They used the island to house rebellious slaves in the 1860s and as a place to quarantine people with yellow fever.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the island is a tourist destination because it is home to giant tortoises. It’s a peaceful sanctuary for this vulnerable species. Some people estimate some of the tortoises on the island are more than 150 years old!</p><p></p><p>To get to Prison Island, you have to take a 25-minute boat ride from Stone Town. Most hotels can help you book a tour or you can head to the beach and look around for someone advertising one. If you want a more in-depth tour with a chance to snorkel, you can&nbsp;book a private tour! If you want a tour that takes you to all the sights in Stone Town and Prison Island all in one day, consider&nbsp;this tour&nbsp;instead. That way, you’ll get to see a bit of everything that Stone Town and Prison Island have to offer!</p><p></p><p>The island is open every day from 9:00 am to 4:15 pm. You can plan to spend about 2-3 hours there during your visit (or longer, depending on the tour you’ve booked). The island does have a $4 USD entrance fee, which may be included with the cost of your tour (make sure to check or ask beforehand!)</p><p></p><h5>10. TRY SNORKELING OR DIVING IN ZANZIBAR AT ONE OF THE ATOLLS</h5><p>If you’re a fan of snorkeling or diving, there are some great places to do this in Zanzibar as well. Mnemba Atoll, located right off the northeast coast, is considered to be the best spot. You’ll see all sorts of colorful fish!</p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Divers, remember – you should have at least a 24-hour rest between your dive and your flight (for your safety!).</em></p><p></p><p>If you’re near Mnemba (Kigomani or Matemwe beach village), you can hire a boat from someone right on the beach. This is the cheapest way to do it, but don’t expect luxury! These boats are not fancy and are about as simple as they come. Also, if you do it this way, don’t forget to bring your own snorkeling mask!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>PRO TIP:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>If you are into photography, you might want a&nbsp;waterproof camera&nbsp;or a&nbsp;GoPro&nbsp;to record everything you see around you!</em></p><p></p><p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Please do not touch the coral while diving or snorkeling. They are really sensitive and it takes years for them to regenerate if you disturb them. Treat the coral with respect. Remember, you are a guest there, so just look, don’t touch!</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>','top-10-unmissable-things-to-do-in-zanzibar','See our recommendation for the Zanzibar tour','/images/067f0ee9-275f-4d6b-86cd-5c9b9756c3e9.jpg','/images/067f0ee9-275f-4d6b-86cd-5c9b9756c3e9.jpg','/images/067f0ee9-275f-4d6b-86cd-5c9b9756c3e9.jpg','Zanzibar is magical: the spice-scented, quintessential Indian Ocean idyll.

Within this small area is a diverse range of habitats; montane forest on the rain-facing wall and grassland on the drier west wall.

It\'s estimated that about 25,000 big animals live within this natural enclosure. Expect to see many animals within a short space of time in the fertile bowl created by the caldera.

If I arrive at the Kilimanjaro or Arusha airport, I would want to go straight to the Serengeti park unless you strongly recommend stopping by another location because it has unique landscapes or wildlife. The primary purpose of this trip is Wildlife photography. My wife would arrive at one of Serengeti\'s air strips on December 30th (probably late in the afternoon) and she would stay with me until the end of the safari.\n\nIn terms of accommodation, I\'m looking for a mid-range lodge / camp that offers good comfort for a reasonable price from December 27th to 30th. I\'m open to your recommendations as long as they are inside the park. We don\'t need to stay in the same camp every night, as I would like to see as much of the park as possible and it may be more convenient to stay in different places.\n\nWe would pick up my wife on December 30th, and I would like to evaluate the following options in your quotation : \n\nOption 1 :\n•	December 30th : Sleep inside the park\n•	December 31st : Serengeti + drive to Ngorongoro in the evening\n•	January 1st : Ngorongoro Crater + drive to Arusha / Kilimanjaro Airport in the evening after the park closes \n\nOption 2 :\n•	December 30th : Sleep inside the park\n•	December 31st : Serengeti during the day + Sleep inside the park at night\n•	January 1st : Drive to Ngorongoro Crater in the morning + Spend afternoon in the park + Sleep next to the park\n•	January 2nd : Spend the morning in the Crater and drive to the airport after lunch \n\nGiven that it is my wife’s first safari and that she isn’t as passionate of wildlife as I am, I would want to stay in a more luxurious type of Lodge.

Both these people went out of their way to make us feel comfortable, safe, and well-fed.\nJoseph was very knowledgeable and did not mind detours to explore more. Our group asked many many questions and he always responded with a smile on his face. Simba made sure we are well-fed at all times.

Jackson arrived promptly to collect us from the Nairobi to Arusha shuttle and took us to the perfectly acceptable Arusha Tourist Inn for the night before we set off from there the next morning with our guide, wildlife expert, and driver Godfrey. Tarangire was amazing, with loads of elephants and other animals but Godfrey took us to a secluded part of the park where we saw a cheetah chase and kill a small gazelle. Overnight was in a pleasant lodge in Manyara where we met our excellent chef Dennis before we drove to the Serengeti. Our time there was extraordinary, seeing so many big cats, including having a pride of lions around our vehicle just after they had killed three zebras, leopards and more cheetahs. Added to this were huge numbers of zebras, and very many other species. We camped two nights there, with feasts provided by Dennis who also made delicious lunches every day. We visited the river with its extraordinary numbers of hippos on the last morning in Serengeti before driving to our camp on the rim of Ngorongoro caldera to camp again, descending into the caldera the next day. It is a beautiful paradise and in addition to all the very many other animals we had seen, we saw rhinos and flamingos before returning to Arusha. Overall we had seen an astounding 55 lions, six cheetahs, three leopards, and thousands of zebras plus so much more, thanks to Godfrey\'s skill and knowledge, had feasted three times a day on the best meals we had in Tanzania thanks to Dennis and the five of us on the trip had lots of laughs with our two experts as well.
